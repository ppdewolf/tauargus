             Only for CPLEX you can add the name of the licence file. It is advised to include the full path.

             in <WRITETABLE> param(4) is added to the file name.
             For the input files a file name without diretpory information is first searched in the directory of the .arb file.
             If it cannot be found there we will then try the param(4) directory.

date       : May 30, 2017
summary    : If no batch output directory has been specified, we now use the directory of the .ARB file as the output directory if no directory info is specified in the <writetable> command.
