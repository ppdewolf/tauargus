## Getting started
A document describing step-by-step the basics of Tau-Argus is available [**here**](https://github.com/sdcTools/manuals/blob/master/tau-argus/Step-by-step%20test%20procedure%20%20TauArgus.pdf). This document is based on version 4.1.7 build 4.

There is a Getting Started document available in [**ppt-format**](https://github.com/sdcTools/manuals/blob/master/tau-argus/Getting%20started%20with%20TauArgus.ppt) as well as in [**pdf-format**](https://github.com/sdcTools/manuals/blob/master/tau-argus/Getting%20started%20with%20TauArgus.pdf).
