<h1>&tau;-ARGUS New experimental developments </h1><p>
<h1>Only for testing by the project team</h1><p>

<h2>&tau;-ARGUS version 3.5.0. B13</h2>
<h2>News</h2>
<hr><i>12 January 2012</i>
As a test non-additive tables can be imported. It will be tricky to apply the suppression based
on the optimisation routines, but the Hypercube is more flexible in this.
<hr><i>28 June  2011</i>
Experiment on request of Luigi: Virgili <br>
1. The audit-routine can also be used before cell suppression.<br>
2. After the cell suppression the status of a secondary can be changed manually.
<hr><i>26 April 2011</i>
Linked tables with modular is now possible<br>
When a set of tables can be seen as as subset of a larger cover table, this set can now be protected.<br>
It is a restriction that the cover table has not more than 4 dimensions.<br>
The problem can also be solved using the hypercube.
<hr><i>10 February 2011</i>
A first version of the incomplete tables option is available.<br>
If not all blocks of a table are filled (e.g different detail in parts of a hierarchical table) &tau;-ARGUS can now handle this.<br>
All 'live' empty cells will be automatically converted into protected cells with value 0.<br>
Then this table will be protected.<br>
Temporarily this only works with tabular input including the status.
This version is needed for protecting linked tabels
<hr><i>1 February 2011</i>
The three singletons-rules (familiar from the modular procedure) are now also available for the full optimisation.<br>
This allows for the additional singleton protection in optimal.<br>
The protection is achieved by adding additional cells (combination of singletons) to the problem
<hr>
<h2>Anco features</h2>
<hr>
Linked tables via the modular protection is available. Both starting from fixed format microdata and from tabular input.<br>
When starting with tables use the option "Open Table set" to load the tables.<br>
When starting with microdata just specify a set op tables. You can then still use global recodings to modify the tables.<br>
Via Modify|Linked tables modular you can start the linked tables procedure. There is a standard automatic procedure to generate the cover table, but it can be done manually ss well.<br>
In batch the command is LINKMOD without additional parameters<br>
<hr>
A JJ-file can be protected directly. Via the menu "Modify|Protect JJ Format" you will be prompted for the name of the inputfile, the output file and a time limit<br>
In batch  the command is  JJ followed by the input, output file and optional the time limit (10 min. by default)
<hr>
Via "Output|Save Table" a table can be stored as a JJ-file.
<hr>
The solver options can be modified, but use with care.
<hr>
The distance funtion can be used as a cost function. see metadata file and the specify tables screen
<hr>
The marginal suppression is available, finding secondaries always in the margins.
The Singleton preprocessing is still available, but not recommended.
<hr>
The Q-parameter is available for the PQ-rule.
<hr>
In the optimisation routines the cost-function is scaled at the interval 0,20000. This max can be changed when specifying the tables (MSC).
